# CodeAlpha_Tasks
I completed an internship at CodeAlpha where I built two frontend projects: a personal portfolio website and a calculator application. These projects helped me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information.
